Talking about Problems and Solutions
There seems to be a problem with the new feature.
Issue number 35402 has been resolved.
Here are the possible solutions:
We could [solution 1] or we could [solution 2]. (e.g. We could add a new button or we could redesign the whole dialog.)
While running the tests we've discovered that [something] is not working properly.
Which option would you like us to work on?
What would you like us to do about [problem]?
The [page feature button] is not working the way it should.
The first solution will take about 3 days and the second one can take up to 10 days.
If we implement the first solution we can have [possible problems] in the future.
However the second solution will take much longer and we cannot give even a rough estimate at the moment.
We'd like to research this problem a bit more in order to give you a more detailed list of options.
